/// A possibly incomplete solution in the line splitting search space.

/// A single [SolveState] binds some subset of the rules to values while
/// leaving the rest unbound. If every rule is bound, the solve state describes
/// a complete solution to the line splitting problem. Even if rules are
/// unbound, a state can also usually be used as a solution by treating all
/// unbound rules as unsplit. (The usually is because a state that constrains
/// an unbound rule to split can't be used with that rule unsplit.)
///
/// From a given solve state, we can explore the search tree to more refined
/// solve states by producing new ones that add more bound rules to the current
/// state.

  /// exploration of the solution space is too branchy and we waste time on

  ///
  /// Here is the key insight. The line splitter treats any unbound rule as
  /// being unsplit. This means refining a solution always means taking a rule
  /// that is unsplit and making it split. That monotonically increases the
  /// cost, but may help fit the solution inside the page.
  ///
  /// We want to keep the cost low, so the only reason to consider making a
  /// rule split is if it reduces an overflowing line. It's also the case that
  /// splitting an earlier rule will often reshuffle the rest of the line.
  ///
  /// Taking that into account, the only rules we consider binding to extend a
  /// solve state are *unbound rules inside the first line that is overflowing*.

  /// down to a few. It also means rules inside lines that already fit are
