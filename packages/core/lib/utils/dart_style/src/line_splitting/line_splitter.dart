/// To ensure the solver doesn't go totally pathological on giant code, we cap

const _maxAttempts = 5000;

/// Takes a set of chunks and determines the best values for its rules in order
/// to fit it inside the page boundary.
///
/// This problem is exponential in the number of rules and a single expression
/// in Dart can be quite large, so it isn't feasible to brute force this. For
/// example:
///
///     outer(
///         fn(1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6, 7 + 8),
///         fn(1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6, 7 + 8),
///         fn(1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6, 7 + 8),
///         fn(1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6, 7 + 8));
///
/// There are 509,607,936 ways this can be split.
///
/// The problem is even harder because we may not be able to easily tell if a
/// given solution is the best one. It's possible that there is *no* solution
/// that fits in the page (due to long strings or identifiers) so the winning
/// solution may still have overflow characters. This makes it hard to know
/// when we are done and can stop looking.
///
/// There are a couple of pieces of domain knowledge we use to cope with this:
///
/// - Changing a rule from unsplit to split will never lower its cost. A
///   solution with all rules unsplit will always be the one with the lowest
///   cost (zero). Conversely, setting all of its rules to the maximum split
///   value will always have the highest cost.
///
///   (You might think there is a converse rule about overflow characters. The
///   solution with the fewest splits will have the most overflow, and the
///   solution with the most splits will have the least overflow. Alas, because
///   of indentation, that isn't always the case. Adding a split may *increase*
///   overflow in some cases.)
///
/// - If all of the chunks for a rule are inside lines that already fit in the
///   page, then splitting that rule will never improve the solution.
///
/// - If two partial solutions have the same cost and the bound rules don't
///   affect any of the remaining unbound rules, then whichever partial
///   solution is currently better will always be the winner regardless of what
///   the remaining unbound rules are bound to.
///
/// We start off with a [SolveState] where all rules are unbound (which
/// implicitly treats them as unsplit). For a given solve state, we can produce
/// a set of expanded states that takes some of the rules in the first long
/// line and bind them to split values. This always produces new solve states
/// with higher cost (but often fewer overflow characters) than the parent
/// state.
///
/// We take these expanded states and add them to a work list sorted by cost.
/// Since unsplit rules always have lower cost solutions, we know that no state
/// we enqueue later will ever have a lower cost than the ones we already have
/// enqueued.
///
/// Then we keep pulling states off the work list and expanding them and adding
/// the results back into the list. We do this until we hit a solution where
/// all characters fit in the page. The first one we find will have the lowest
/// cost and we're done.
///
/// We also keep running track of the best solution we've found so far that
/// has the fewest overflow characters and the lowest cost. If no solution fits,
/// we'll use this one.
///
/// When enqueing a solution, we can sometimes collapse it and a previously
/// queued one by preferring one or the other. If two solutions have the same
/// cost and we can prove that they won't diverge later as unbound rules are
/// set, we can pick the winner now and discard the other. This lets us avoid
/// redundantly exploring entire subtrees of the solution space.
///
/// As a final escape hatch for pathologically nasty code, after trying some
/// fixed maximum number of solve states, we just bail and return the best
/// solution found so far.
///
/// Even with the above algorithmic optimizations, complex code may still
/// require a lot of exploring to find an optimal solution. To make that fast,
/// this code is carefully profiled and optimized. If you modify this, make
/// sure to test against the benchmark to ensure you don't regress performance.
