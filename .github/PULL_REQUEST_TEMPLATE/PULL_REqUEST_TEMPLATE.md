Thank you for opening a Pull Request!
Before submitting your PR, there are a few things you can do to make sure it goes smoothly:
- [ ] Make sure to open a GitHub issue as a bug/feature request before writing your code! That way we can discuss the change, evaluate designs, and agree on the general idea
  - [ ] Ensure the tests (`melos unit:test-script`)
  - [ ] Ensure the analyzer and formatter pass (`melos run format` to automatically apply formatting)
- [ ] Appropriate docs were updated (if necessary)
